^ I knew that WooCommerce was going to be a good product even before I tried it because I had previous used and modified Features & Testimonials.

^ Leo Babauta blogs several times a week so you can understand him and then he releases premium contests, groups, videos, etc.

^ A friend of mine, Kevin McLeod, who scores music gives away a ton of music so people know his name
